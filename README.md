freeCodeCamp Nana Tribute Page

This is one of my projects for fCC's Responsive Web Design Course. We had to create a tribute page for the subject of our choosing. Seeing as I am a big fan of the anime Nana, I decided to create this simple tribute page for Nana. 

## Prerequisites

**Web Browser:** You will need a web browser installed to view the tribute page.
