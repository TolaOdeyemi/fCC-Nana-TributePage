When Ai Yazawa briefly resurfaced in August 2022 to discuss her upcoming art exhibit, sale records for the manga spiked, and merch sold incredibly well at several sites.</p>

       Nana O is an aspiring artist who dreams of fame, whilst Hachi persues romance. Though an unlikely pairing, the two end up living together and grow closer as their lives become more entwined.

  <h4 id="headings" class="heading4">Critical Acclaim</h4>
  <div id="paragraph3" class="acclaim">
    <p>Generally, Nana is praised and well received by critics. In 2003, it won the 48th Shogakukan Manga award in the shoujo category. 
      The United State's Young Adult Library Services Association listed the series in its 'Great Graphic Novels For Teens' list.
      Deb Aoki of About.com ranked Nana as the fifth "Must-Read" shōjo manga series in its "Top shojo Manga Must-Reads" list, with Aoki stating the manga is "a beautifully-drawn series that is filled with heartfelt drama, big city glamor, fabulous fashion, rock and roll sass and many unexpected twists." She also ranked the manga in its "50 Essential Manga for Libraries" list, noting its mature themes and "demonstrates the need for an adult collection."
       In a survey conducted by Goo in 2012 among 1,939 people, Nana was among the top favorite manga for women.
       The individual chapters of Nana have been collected into twenty-one tankōbon volumes, but its latest four chapters have not been published in a tankōbon volume- to fans chagrin.
       Even so, of September 2019, the manga has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, and volume 21 debuted at number 9 on the NYT's Graphic Novel's bestseller list. There is currently high demand for the manga to be printed, with there being a massive backlog of pre-orders at bookstores worldwide.

    <p>Despite how long it's been since its release, Nana is still incredibly popular and holds an immense ammount of influence not just over it's fanbase, but over the shoujo community.
      Ai Yazawa is a huge fan of Vivian Westwood and she always incorporates her designs into her work- Nana's favourite ring is from Vivian Westwood, as well as the first dress she ever purchased- also her favourite. Fans of the manga and anime buy Vivian Westwood jewlerry because of this.
      The Black Stones and TRAPNEST- fictional bands created by Ai Yazawa which feature in both the manga and anime- as well as characters from the source material, has inspired several songs and tribute albums from real life artists and bands. Punk Night has two songs inspired by Nana: From Nana and Nana's Song Is My Song. EMI Music Japan released an album called 'Love For Nana' in which Glen Matlock of The Sex Pistols contributed alongside other famous artists.
      Two video games titled 'Nana' was released for playstation as well as one being produced for nintendo DS.
      The manga and anime has a large following on tiktok, where fans of the source material film skits, dissect the themes explored and rant about problematic characters (mostly Reira and Takumi). </p>
